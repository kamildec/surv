# Time-dependent explanations of neural networks for survival analysis

## Introduction

This is a repository for the code and the results for a MIM UW XAI project, in which we wish to provide time-dependent explanations of neural networks for survival analysis.

**Team:** Kamil Grudzie≈Ñ, Krystian Sztenderski, Jakub Bednarz.
